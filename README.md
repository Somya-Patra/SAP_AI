# DATA_STORYTELLER

Data Analytics coupled with Artificial Intelligence can be leveraged for transforming businesses to the next level
Currently, people are hired as Data Analysts to analyze the data and find relevant patterns in them so that the derived knowledge can be used to make informed critical business decisions. But this requires a lot of man power, time and  money. Additionally, the traditional methods are subject to human errors as well as suboptimal results. Many businesses may not be able to afford the time it takes for human analysis or budget to hire a seasoned analyst.
Hence, there is a serious need to develop an artificial tool which can analyze the data and draw user oriented insights efficiently for both small and big enterprises


We are proposing an AI based tool that can take a data set, identify patterns in the data, can interpret the result and then produce an output story that is understandable and relevant to a business user based on the context of the data
Our model is efficient in analyzing data on behalf of users and generates smart feeds using Machine Learning , Natural Language Processing and Tkinter for GUI
As our model is not hard coded to any specific input, it is capable of analyzing datasets of different departments and generate solutions as per their requirements
Tools\Packages used include Python, Scikitlearn ,NLTK ,Tkinter,Seaborn ,Matplotlib ,SciPy, Numpy,Pandas, Pillow
We have assumed four main types of business users i.e, HR, Sales, Operations and Finance. We have provided four different types of datasets to the model for training purpose so that it can address the informational needs as per the respective departmental requirements. 
Our model is completely based upon Python libraries and ML/NLP techniques, and can be applied on any platform to turn the raw data into interactive data stories
Our solution is a user-friendly interactive tool and has personalization feature that generates information relevant to a given user. The solution has been made reconfigurable in order to generate additional insights based on end userâ€™s needs.
